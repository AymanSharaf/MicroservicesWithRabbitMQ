# Microservices with RabbitMQ
This repository is the implementation of this [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/getting-started-net-core-microservices-rabbitmq/) course.  
Soon i will start enhancing it to match what i believe is better practices.
## To Do:  
1.Use Docker  
2.Remove IOC Project and use autofac + Dynamic Dlls loading  
3.Move Command Handlers to Application layer  
4.Re-implement service bus using EasyNetQ or MassTransit  
5.Better encapsulate domain models  
6.Consider Shared Projects (Event Bus, Transfer Service)  
7.Consider API Gatewaty  
8.Review the dependancy on MediatR in Core Project  
9.Logging (Maybe ELK or EFK)  
10.Securing APIs  
11.Angular Front-End
